Telling the necessary things
Looking forward to creating a bot. When I was a child my dad showed me one at restaurant back when there were no waitresses or waiters. I want to make a bot for retailers. One for bot for every name brand sold in the store. It would control a rotating closet to display all name brand merchandise to a customer who wants to buy it. A common example is the dry cleaners but it would be a checkout bot or a bot located in dressing room.
